To create a bookmarklet, you must first have [created an incoming webhook](../../integrations/incoming-webhook).

Once the webhook has been created, you can drag the bookmarklet icon {{< icon name="bookmark" size="large" >}} into your browser's favorites.

You can rename the bookmarklet as you wish.

While browsing the web, if you are interested in a page, click on the link in your favorites.

A message should confirm that the page has been added to your playback feed.
